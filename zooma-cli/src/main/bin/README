| ZOOMA Scripts |
+---------------+

This directory contains scripts for interacting with ZOOMA.  A brief outline of each script is included below.

zooma.sh
--------

The script for running ZOOMA searches for your data.  In-line help is provided (run with -h argument) and user
documentation is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/FGPTO/Zooma

zooma-loading.sh
----------------

Runs the ZOOMA loader to generate annotation RDF from the configured datasources.

zooma-loading.lsf
-----------------

A ZOOMA loader that executes in an interactive shell on the EBI LSF cluster.  This script runs in the foreground but
does not use resources on the local machine

zooma-loading-submit.lsf
------------------------

A ZOOMA loader that submits a job from execution on the EBI LSF cluster.  Because this executes the submit command, it
runs in the background: you don't have to wait for results.  Use this if you are running the RDF generation by hand
and you will be emailed the results.

build-owlim-index.sh
--------------------

A script that consumes and RDF directory and an output directory and generates an OWLIM index from the given RDF files.

build-lucene-index.sh
---------------------

A script that queries a sparql endpoint for raw annotation data and generates a Lucene index in the format expected by
the ZOOMA web application.
