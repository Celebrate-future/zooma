Protocol Description	Cells were exposed to 100 uM phenylephrine (Sigma) for 0, 30 or 60 min. Phenylephrine was dissolved in MilliQ water (100 mM stock) and added directly to the tissue culture medium to give a final concentration of 100 µM. Cells were harvested simultaneously in RNAzol B.	.CEL files were imported into GeneSpring and transformed with using ExonRMA16 to generate RNA expression measures (as Log2 values). Please note the composite sequence identifiers in this file are the cluster ID	Pooled ventricles were digested with collagenase (0.4 mg/ml) and pancreatin (0.6 mg/ml) in 116 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.35), 0.8 mM Na2HPO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4. Cells were recovered by centrifugation (5 min, 60 x g) and resuspended in plating medium [68% (v/v) Dulbecco's modified Eagele's medium, 17% (v/v) M199, 15% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin]. Cells were pre-plated (37C, 30 min) to remove non-myocytes. Non-adherent cardiac myocytes were plated at 4 million cells per 60mm Primaria tissue culture dish and cultured for 18 h in plating medium. Serum was withdrawn and cells cultured in 80% DMEM/20%MEM for 24 h. References: Bogoyevitch MA et al. Biochem J 309: 437–443, 1995; Iwaki K et al. J Biol Chem 265: 13809–13817, 1990. (Parameters: start time = 0, time unit = seconds, min temperature = 37, temperature unit = C, media = DMEM/MEM)	1 ml RNAzol B added to each 60 mm Primaria tissue culture dish.  RNA was solubilised by passing the lysate 5 times through the pipette tip and samples collected into Eppendorf tubes.  0.1 ml chloroform was added and samples were shaken vigorously for 15 s then incubated on ice (5 min).  Samples were centrifuged (12,000 g, 4°C, 15 min).  The upper aqueous phase was transfered to a clean tube and an equal volume of isopropanol added.  Samples incubated on ice (15 min) then centrifuged (12,000 g, 4°C, 15 min) to pellet the RNA precipitate.  The RNA pellet was washed once with 0.8 ml 75% ethanol and the pellet dried briefly under vacuum (10 min).  The RNA pellet was dissolved in l mM EDTA, pH 7.0.  The purity was assessed by examination of the 18S and 28S bands after gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, and from the A260/A280 (values of 1.9–2.1 were considered acceptable). RNA concentrations were determined from the A260.  <br><br><br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Data in .CEL files were analysed using GeneSpring 12 with ExonRMA16 summarization algorithm.
