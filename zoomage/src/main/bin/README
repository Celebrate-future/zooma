+-----------------+

This directory contains scripts for interacting with Zoomage.  A brief outline of each script is included below.

zoomage.sh
--------

The overall program takes a MAGETAB accession number, parses it using the Limpopo web service and applies
automatic curation using the Zooma webservice.

Produces two spreadsheets (SDRF and IDF) resulting from the zooma curation process. Currently, IDF is returned
only for convenience, no zoomification is applied yet.

Takes three arguments - the accession to retrieve from ArrayExpress,
the threshold for the minimum string length to initiate a zooma query, and the zooma cutoff percentage (eg .8
discards the bottom 80% of matches and retains just the top 20%.
