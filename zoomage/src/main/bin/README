This directory contains scripts for interacting with Zoomage.  A brief outline of each script is included below.

zoomage.sh

The overall program takes a MAGETAB study number, parses it using the Limpopo web service and applies
automatic curation using the Zooma webservice.

Produces two spreadsheets (SDRF and IDF) resulting from the zooma curation process. Currently, no zoomification
is yet applied to the IDF; the IDF is returned only for convenience, .

Takes several arguments. To print the help, run the program with -h option.
