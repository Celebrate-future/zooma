ZOOMA is an optimal ontology mapping application developed by the Functional Genomics Production team at the European Bioinformatics Institute.

This is the publicly available code repository for ZOOMA.  Currently, this only includes the core libraries for ZOOMA - there are no generic user interface implementations available, only the EBI internal version that is visible at the ZOOMA homepage listed below.  We're in the process of adding support for building customized versions of ZOOMA with your own data, and we will update these pages when this is available.

Developer documentation is currently in the process of being written.  There are some developer documents on the ZOOMA docs pages, and more details about this codebase will be available soon, but in the meantime feel free to email the lead developer, Tony Burdett, on tburdett@ebi.ac.uk.
